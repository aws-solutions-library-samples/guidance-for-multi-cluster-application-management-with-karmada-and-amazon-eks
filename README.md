This guidance describes the procedure how to deploy a federated Kubernetes environment in [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/) cloud using [Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) and the open source [Kubernetes Armada (Karmada)](https://karmada.io/) project. Karmada is a Kubernetes management system, with advanced scheduling capabilities, that enables you to run your cloud-native applications across multiple Kubernetes clusters and clouds, with no changes to your applications.
